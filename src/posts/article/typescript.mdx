Hey everyone! ðŸ˜‡

I recently signed up for Dickie Bush & Nicolas Cole's cohort-based course, Ship 30 for 30. It's been a while, and I'm finally ready to start sharing my thoughts online.

## Recently, I've been diving into three big themes:

1// Understanding knowledge consumption from first principles, digital second brain and how is our information experience evolving.

2// Delving deep into the world of designâ€”from fundamentals to fascinating applications.

3// Investigating how future technologies, especially deep tech, will shape our world.

Join me on this adventureâ€”and let me know if you have any questions along the way!

I'm excited to start sharing what I know online.
