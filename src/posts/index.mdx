title: Hello there!
---

Hello, my name is Navin! üëãüèª I am an entrepreneur with a strong interest in addressing global issues through innovative and sustainable solutions.

- I‚Äôm an engineer with a MSc in Economics & Strategy from Imperial College London.

- I co-founded [Samudai](https://samudai.xyz), a Web3 SaaS platform for DAOs, where we raised [$2.5 million](https://inc42.com/buzz/samudai-raises-pre-seed-funding-to-help-manage-build-communities-in-web3-ecosystem/amp/) in pre-seed funding. At Samudai, I led operations, product, growth, and hiring.

- Prior to founding Samudai, I worked in venture capital ([Lunar Ventures](https://lunar.vc/), a ‚Ç¨40M deep-tech fund) and strategy consulting ([Capco](https://www.capco.com/services/digital/digital-innovation), [RedSeer](https://redseer.com/)).

- I love reading, learning and writing about technologies that are ahead of the curve.

- I take pleasure in long motorbike rides (over 15K+ kms) and exploring culinary delights in different cities.
