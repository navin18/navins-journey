title: Hello there!
---

Hello, my name is Navin! üëãüèª I am an entrepreneur with a strong interest in addressing global issues through innovative and sustainable solutions.

- I‚Äôm an engineer with a PG in Economics & Strategy from Imperial College London.

- I co-founded Samudai, a Web3 SaaS platform for DAOs, where we raised $2.5 million in pre-seed funding. At Samudai, I led operations, product, growth, and hiring.

- Prior to founding Samudai, I worked in venture capital (Lunar Ventures, a ‚Ç¨40M deep-tech fund) and strategy consulting (Capco, RedSeer).

- I love reading, learning and writing about technologies that are ahead of the curve.

- I take pleasure in long motorbike rides (over 15K+ kms) and exploring culinary delights in different cities. 

### Themes that excite me

My fascination with front-end development began in the early 2000s, a time when websites were a blend of table layouts and experimental CSS. Since then, I‚Äôve witnessed the rise of responsive design, the advent of CSS preprocessors, and the revolution brought about by JavaScript frameworks. What captivates me most about front-end development is the power to bring designs to life, creating interactive experiences that engage and inspire.

### Public speaking

I used to get butterflies just thinking about speaking in front of others, but now, you'll often find me sharing my coding adventures and front-end tips at meetups and webinars. It's been quite the journey from nervous wreck to someone who actually enjoys the spotlight. Every talk, with its own set of hiccups and high fives, has helped me get better at breaking down tricky topics into fun, digestible bits. Honestly, it's pretty cool to connect with folks who geek out over the same stuff I do, and I'm all about making tech talks as enjoyable as a chat over coffee.
